# Food Database

Live site: https://eamoses.github.io/food-database/

Using the GAS Stack API, I hooked this up to a Google Sheet that holds the types of foods I currently have in my kitchen, and the amounts of each food, and displays them according to category.

When you check one food off, it strikes a line thru on the UI and removes it from the Google Sheet permanently.

It is possible to update the sheet with the amounts of each type of food.

Finally, being able to add foods via the UI instead of only having the option to update the Google Sheet would be ideal.

Also, it would be neat to use the Unsplash API to frequently display a different food picture as the background.

Itâ€™s helpful as long as I keep it up to date when I go shopping!
