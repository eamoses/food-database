# Food Database

Live site: https://eamoses.github.io/food-database/

I hooked it up to a Google Sheet that holds the types of foods I currently have in my kitchen, and the amounts of each food, and displays them according to category.

I plugged in the functionality so that when you check one off, it strikes a line thru and removes it from the Google Sheet permanently.

I will also be able to update the sheet with the amounts of each type of food.

Finally, being able to add foods via the UI instead of only having the option to update the Google Sheet would be ideal.

Itâ€™s helpful as long as I keep the Google Sheet up to date when I go shopping!
